# Time Dilation Simulator

### Overview
The **Time Dilation Simulator** is an interactive app that demonstrates the relativistic effects of time dilation as described by Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity. As an object's velocity approaches the speed of light (C), time slows down relative to a stationary observer.

This effect is quantified by the **Lorentz factor** (γ), which describes how time is experienced by a moving object compared to someone at rest.

In this simulator, users can adjust the velocity of an object and observe how clocks move at different rates depending on their speed. The ticking of the clock also changes, slowing down as the object's velocity increases.

### Features
- Adjust the object's velocity from rest up to speeds approaching light speed.
- Visual representation of clocks running at different rates based on the selected velocity.
- Audio feedback simulating the ticking sound of a clock, which slows down as time dilates.

### How Time Dilation Works
According to the theory of Special Relativity, time dilation occurs when an object moves at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated as:

$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
$$

Where:
- `v` is the velocity of the moving object.
- `c` is the speed of light.

As `v` approaches `c`, the denominator approaches zero, causing γ to increase. This results in time passing more slowly for the moving object as seen by a stationary observer.

### Usage
Once the simulator is running, use the interface to:

1. Select a velocity to set the object's speed.
2. Observe the changing speeds of the clocks, representing time dilation at different velocities.
3. Listen to the ticking sound of the clock slowing down as the object's Lorentz Factor increases.
